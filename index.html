                        <h3> Feeding Hungry People Program </h3>
                        <br>
                        Hunger is biggest problem across the globe. As per World Health Organisation we produce food that
                        is enough to feed double the population of the world, but still around 20 million people don't
                        have enough food to feed themselves.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a part of this program we collect unspoiled foods from school, universities,campuses and
                        distribute to the people in need.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This Feeding Hungry People program was intiated in 2010 in support of fight against hunger.
                        And today we have 1000+ volunteers present across 10+ cities in India, and has served 5 million
                        people in need.
